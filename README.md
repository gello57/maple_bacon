maple_bacon - A Simple Recipe Catalogue
===========

This is a project that my wife and I have wanted to start for a long time.  We like to create recipes, and take existing recipes, modify them for our tastes and ingredients, then  note our changes so we can make the same dish again.  This will be our own recipe database or catalogue. 

The reason we're making this ourselves, is that we have not been happy with any of the existing online recipe database products.  Most of them are needlessly complicated, trying to be everything for everyone.  This app will be designed for our minimal needs.  To start with, it will be very simple and easy to read on a mobile, tablet - or printed document (without the need for a 'print' format).  Should be fun!
